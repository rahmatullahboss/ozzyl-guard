# Ozzyl Guard Documentation Index

This directory is the long-term product and engineering source of truth. New developers and AI agents should start with `../tracker.yml`, `../AGENTS.md`, and the handoff files under `../.ai-bridge/`, then read the documents relevant to the change.

## Current verified milestone

The repository/provider/queue metrics milestone is merged on `main` as `53b882028292a2a6c0a71da19540dba97c95ea9f`. Feature CI run `30329769797`, job `90182279338`, passed thirteen migrations, 20 typechecks, 31 Turbo tasks with 168 assertions, 20 builds, GitGuardian, audit, clean restore, runtime-role, and PHP gates. Durable courier, webhook, and verification repositories now expose bounded transition timing and aggregate queue depth/oldest-ready-age; courier API/browser, webhook HTTP, and OTP delivery boundaries expose broad provider-call outcomes without identifiers, tenant scope, contact data, credentials, URLs, vendor names, payloads, responses, or arbitrary error labels.

## Documentation rules

- Change code and its contract documentation together.
- Add a new ADR when changing a system boundary, infrastructure choice, data model strategy, or security model.
- Never remove historical ADRs or edit already-applied migrations to make a new change appear older.
- Update `../tracker.yml` and `../.ai-bridge/implementation-status.md` after every material milestone.
- Keep remaining risks, external dependencies, rollback considerations, and verification evidence explicit.
