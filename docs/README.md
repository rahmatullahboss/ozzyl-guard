# Ozzyl Guard Documentation Index

This directory is the long-term product and engineering source of truth. New developers and AI agents should start with `../tracker.yml`, `../AGENTS.md`, and the handoff files under `../.ai-bridge/`, then read the documents relevant to the change.

## Current verified milestone

The durable work retention milestone is merged on `main` as `8788da49db5bc0726db97ad0b021fd30b06600e5`. Feature CI run `30325144458`, job `90168867190`, passed thirteen migrations, 20 typechecks, 31 Turbo tasks with 154 assertions, 20 builds, GitGuardian, audit, clean restore, runtime-role, and PHP gates. Old terminal courier, webhook, and verification work can now be previewed and archived only through the maintenance boundary; archive evidence is secret-free, records the maintenance database identity, is persisted before source deletion, and remains inaccessible to application runtime roles.

## Documentation rules

- Change code and its contract documentation together.
- Add a new ADR when changing a system boundary, infrastructure choice, data model strategy, or security model.
- Never remove historical ADRs or edit already-applied migrations to make a new change appear older.
- Update `../tracker.yml` and `../.ai-bridge/implementation-status.md` after every material milestone.
- Keep remaining risks, external dependencies, rollback considerations, and verification evidence explicit.
