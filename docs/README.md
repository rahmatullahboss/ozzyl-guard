# Ozzyl Guard Documentation Index

This directory is the long-term product and engineering source of truth. New developers and AI agents should start with `../tracker.yml`, `../AGENTS.md`, and the handoff files under `../.ai-bridge/`, then read the documents relevant to the change.

## Current verified milestone

The selected-source post-persist native shadow pilot foundation is merged on `main` as `c478170c7dadbeafa576a62ae989df682e052d4e`. Final feature CI run `29629751800`, job `88040964883`, passed eleven migrations, 19 typechecks, 28 test tasks with 120 assertions, 19 builds, and PHP syntax at tested head `57e6b296617549e923fc80ab80b0317f109f5ee8`. Production rollout remains default `off`; the next operational step is explicit pilot-store deployment and outcome calibration, not enforcement.

## Documentation rules

- Change code and its contract documentation together.
- Add a new ADR when changing a system boundary, infrastructure choice, data model strategy, or security model.
- Never remove historical ADRs or edit already-applied migrations to make a new change appear older.
- Update `../tracker.yml` and `../.ai-bridge/implementation-status.md` after every material milestone.
- Keep remaining risks, external dependencies, rollback considerations, and verification evidence explicit.
